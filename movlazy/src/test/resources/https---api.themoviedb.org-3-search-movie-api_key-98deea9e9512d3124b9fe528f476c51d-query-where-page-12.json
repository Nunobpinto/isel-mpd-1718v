The insistence of this male voice, which repeats the phrase “Jennifer! Where are you?” every 30 seconds, parodies the authority conceded to voice-overs in the cinema. The voice is patriarchal, relentless, and runs the entire length of the film. Cut-aways to a small girl, glancing at the camera as she plays with lipstick and matches, reapportion the relation between patriarchal phonocentrism and masculine gaze. But is this small child subject to either? No. Not really. There she is, hiding in plain sight–ours, not ‘his’–a ‘purloined subject’ successfully evading subjugation through response or acquiescence. ‘Jennifer,’ whoever she might be (a cipher, a pseudonymous textual marker of gendered cinematic presence) is never apprehended, and the film, for all of its suspense, simply ends.","release_date":"1981-01-01"},{"vote_count":0,"id":353139,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Where the North Begins","popularity":1.01265,"poster_path":"\/9dKhv6Cj17VQK6jzKJY1YZkRgqI.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Where the North Begins","genre_ids":[80,37],"backdrop_path":"\/wxDwlziVurmRw0r3Gdl8IEcy3Jq.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"A Canadian Mountie investigates the disappearance of a brother officer.","release_date":"1947-12-14"},{"vote_count":0,"id":190797,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Where I Begin","popularity":1.011529,"poster_path":null,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Where I Begin","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"A decade after a tragic event, Jacob decides to return home to his small southern roots, only to find that the past is not really the past and that people may change but they never forget.

How are these dogs related to the inhabitants of the city? People love or hate them? Could be established a parallelism between the life of the dogs and the life of the people? Finally this reflection would consider the general perception of Ethiopia from the West and would play experimentally with the western prejudices to display an ironic film with certain doses of black humor.

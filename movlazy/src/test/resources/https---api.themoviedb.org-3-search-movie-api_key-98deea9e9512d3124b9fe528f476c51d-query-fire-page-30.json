Twists and turns in the lava's flow leave some patches of original ecosystems, called kipukas, undisturbed.  These oases of life provide a haven to many rare creatures - including the Hawaiian state bird, the Nene - but remain in constant danger from the volcano and from invasive species.  At the end of its journey, the lava meets the ocean.  Braving an extremely hot sea, filmmakers record the birth of new land.","release_date":""},{"vote_count":0,"id":359863,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Fire is a Nightmare – Tom","popularity":1,"poster_path":"\/nD301anMvc0EnVPjDQwUUDSOe7Y.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Fire is a Nightmare – Tom","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Part of BFI collection \"Worth the Risk?\"","release_date":"1975-01-02"},{"vote_count":0,"id":311337,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Pride FC: Fists of Fire","popularity":1,"poster_path":null,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Pride FC: Fists of Fire","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"The Japanese Pride Fighting Championships -- the world's ultimate mixed martial arts event -- showcases the judo, karate, jiu jitsu, kickboxing and wrestling talents of the world's fiercest fighters.

The final outrage occurs during a battle between the Austrians and the Italians in the Dolomites, culminating with the destruction of an entire mountain (hence the film's title).

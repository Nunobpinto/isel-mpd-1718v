No camping, no white-water rafting, no vacation at all. So it doesn't surprise anyone that the young witch is quite disgruntled when arriving at Altenberg Castle. Her roommate is a touchy unpleassant fashion victim and headmaster Quirin Bartels is so muddle-headed that he can't even remember the names of his students properly. But then Bibi makes friends with Elea, a girl wheelchair-bound since a terrible accident where she also lost her beloved parents. Now Bibi is determined to help the sensitive Elea, searching a way to heal her from her palsy legs.","poster_path":"\/nOfVyXDmzvwknKZigm2CkmZMhsX.jpg"},{"character":"Paul","credit_id":"57a48c52c3a3684917003540","release_date":"2012-08-30","vote_count":1,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":2,"title":"Into the Blue","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Ins Blaue","popularity":1.063367,"id":338334,"backdrop_path":"\/lFmFqk7R6FQepJoFWu7N9caZ3Fr.jpg","overview":"A story of a film-making crew traveling in Italy.","poster_path":"\/54oTKba2PjKPoMQRsiWY3LnQ9rK.jpg"},{"character":"Sportlehrer","credit_id":"594bafa0925141311f010585","release_date":"2007-02-11","vote_count":2,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6.5,"title":"Guten Morgen, Herr Grothe","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Guten Morgen, Herr Grothe","popularity":1.005757,"id":207341,"backdrop_path":"\/yM4TorL4ogrH2Ubo2C4iqFKIYB1.jpg","overview":"","poster_path":"\/hAO9N1BWAlKyUksR36ezeo6cuBT.jpg"},{"character":"Georg","credit_id":"59caaf6d9251412bcd0022f5","release_date":"2017-03-16","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Das leise Rauschen zwischen den Dingen","genre_ids":[],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Das leise Rauschen zwischen den Dingen","popularity":1,"id":478165,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null}],"crew":[],"id":1486433}

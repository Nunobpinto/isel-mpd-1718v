It all comes to a head during a food shortage in Pecos, a near-disaster that persuades the wagon master to switch sides once again. When the dust settles, Zack learns that old man Gardner is actually Carl Anderson, the man who murdered his father.","poster_path":"\/tDyQtQvXwBrwcXFhDjKYPbs4iA0.jpg"},{"character":"Fire Chief","credit_id":"5742b5c8925141111a0014f7","release_date":"1942-09-01","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Henry Aldrich, Editor","genre_ids":[35],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Henry Aldrich, Editor","popularity":1.002063,"id":111462,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"Henry (James Lydon) gets into another jam when he becomes the editor of the Centerville Hish School newspaper.

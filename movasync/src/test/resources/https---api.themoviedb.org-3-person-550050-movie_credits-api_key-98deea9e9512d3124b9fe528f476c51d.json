As a sort of sequel to the classic The Guns (1964), following the fate of those characters as they move from enforcers of exploitation to exploited, it offers more than a snapshot of the period: the correspondent time lapses in fiction and reality capture the passage of a chunk of Brazilian history between the two films, and, therefore, also the transformations in cinematographic approaches to the social and political between the two moments. Equally daring in content and form, and in the originality of the adequacy of one to the other, it won the Silver Bear at Berlin.","poster_path":"\/pXHZPbuZfRS28eUc8XqSRtXCj0J.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c91121e1f","poster_path":"\/600bQW44tRJdMarmXoagEh0I8b9.jpg","id":250520,"video":false,"vote_count":2,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"pt","original_title":"Lance Maior","popularity":1.143756,"title":"Lance Maior","vote_average":4.3,"overview":"University student who works in a bank experiences a personal crisis: he is torn between his ambitions and the temptation to engage in the armed movement against the military dictatorship of the time, in Brazil.

As usual, the director exploits all cinematic constituents in his palette – a radically intrusive and discordant soundtrack, non sequitur editing, exaggerated camera angles and all manner of carnivalesque pageantry – to illustrate the tale of a doctor\/priest on a mission to discover truth through the study of madness. The population of his asylum grows as his definition of sanity fluctuates until it finally threatens to incorporate the entire town. The film’s own irrational reversals and allegorical codes gleefully mock the arbitrariness of authoritarianism in all its varied guises. -Harvard Film Archive","poster_path":"\/237bKKD8Em23w6sGrNWLjSHMpIh.jpg"},{"character":"Madalena","credit_id":"55f294a8c3a3682303004155","release_date":"1972-06-01","vote_count":2,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6,"title":"São Bernardo","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"pt","original_title":"São Bernardo","popularity":1.000063,"id":253380,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"The story of Paulo Honório, a poor kid who becomes a rich farmer.

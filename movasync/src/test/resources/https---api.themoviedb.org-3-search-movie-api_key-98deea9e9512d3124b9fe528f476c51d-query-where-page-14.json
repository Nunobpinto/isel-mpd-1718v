Assuming \"the Lord's will\" determines the fate of his ailing son Edmund, Philip Gosse creates a life-threatening situation, even suggesting the illness is God's punishment because of Edmund's desire for a toy ship.","release_date":"1976-04-21"},{"vote_count":0,"id":169395,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Where I Am","popularity":1.000001,"poster_path":"\/emuF4vFVexe5va7vBPeDThj2uWw.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Where I Am","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"In this documentary, Gay American writer Robert Drake returns to the small town of Sligo from his home in Philadelphia, in an attempt to revisit the memories of his time in Ireland.

George Dixon (Warner) a long-serving traditional \"copper\" who is due to retire shortly, takes a new recruit, Andy Mitchell (Hanley), under his aegis, introducing him to the easy-going night beat. Dixon is a classic Ealing 'ordinary' hero, but also anachronistic, unprepared and unable to answer the violence of Tom Riley (Bogarde). Called to the scene of a robbery at a local cinema, Dixon finds himself face-to-face with Riley, a desperate youth armed with a revolver. Dixon initially tries to talk Riley into surrendering the weapon, but Riley panics and fires. Dixon walks to his own death almost uncomprehending. Dixon is taken to hospital, but dies some hours later. The ending is another Ealing quirk, with ordinary decent society, including 'professional' criminals used to violence, banding together to track down and catch the murderer, who is trapped in the crowd at White City greyhound track in west London. To Andy Mitchell falls the honour of arresting Riley.","vote_count":18,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/nXPdlR0SzomINpBC9c9me3eUftF.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/s3zEkMYOulyRM73vhpTTCNudY1d.jpg","title":"The Blue Lamp","popularity":4.281827,"genre_ids":[80,18],"vote_average":7,"adult":false,"release_date":"1950-06-01","credit_id":"56f01a61c3a368717d0001c9"},{"id":137378,"department":"Camera","original_language":"en","original_title":"The Siege of Sidney Street","job":"Camera Operator","overview":"A police inspector (Donald Sinden) tracks down Russian anarchist Peter the Painter (Peter Wyngarde) and his gang in circa-1911 London.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/5CByeHyI6GrGEuUgY49noOKe3N2.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"The Siege of Sidney Street","popularity":1.020862,"genre_ids":[18],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1960-10-11","credit_id":"5787ac4bc3a36839300005da"},{"id":155331,"department":"Camera","original_language":"en","original_title":"Cage of Gold","job":"Camera Operator","overview":"A young woman, Judith Moray, deserts her prospective fiance, the nice doctor Alan Kearn, for an old flame, the dashing but roguish former wing commander Bill Glennan.

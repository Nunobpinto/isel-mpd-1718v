The book's story tells of young love and suicide. In this East German film, based on a book by Thomas Mann, Lotte (Lilli Palmer) was the woman who served as the model for the heroine in the novel Werther. She comes to Goethe's hometown for a visit, and her experiences there eerily re-create episodes from the book. Goethe comes across as a pompous old bore, and his friends as pandering sycophants, in this very proper communist party-sponsored, anti-heroic movie.","poster_path":"\/ssmr0BpVEZV2Lw9QLZAJqH31Wdx.jpg"},{"character":"Puppentheaterdirektor Eisenbeiß","credit_id":"5666f127c3a36808ec001035","release_date":"1967-11-03","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Turlis Abenteuer","genre_ids":[14,10751],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Turlis Abenteuer","popularity":1.001902,"id":371685,"backdrop_path":"\/8m06VJOPqic4cu721aOGpgUqUnu.jpg","overview":"","poster_path":"\/bYJUlWa4dpYgpZCOAsd6uOO067o.jpg"},{"character":"Pastor Himmelknecht","credit_id":"5692d70c92514115c2002d2a","release_date":"1977-09-22","vote_count":1,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6.5,"title":"Ein irrer Duft von frischem Heu","genre_ids":[35],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Ein irrer Duft von frischem Heu","popularity":1.000044,"id":376963,"backdrop_path":"\/dFIG65xH0XN0pkTPSpEO5AH9ybq.jpg","overview":"","poster_path":"\/g9TqJGh9wsLdAJPQmkNBM74LIiC.jpg"},{"character":"Dunkelberg","credit_id":"59f3bc26c3a3681f63000eb3","release_date":"1989-12-17","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Die gestundete Zeit","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Die gestundete Zeit","popularity":1,"id":483797,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null},{"character":"","credit_id":"5b02724bc3a3686c7a0138fb","poster_path":null,"id":423509,"video":false,"vote_count":0,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[80],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Treffpunkt Genf","popularity":1.002309,"title":"Treffpunkt Genf","vote_average":0,"overview":"","release_date":"1968-01-28"}],"crew":[{"id":439287,"department":"Directing","original_language":"en","original_title":"Senta auf Abwegen","job":"Director","overview":"Film by Martin Hellberg.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":null,"backdrop_path":null,"title":"Senta auf Abwegen","popularity":1.002119,"genre_ids":[],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1959-07-16","credit_id":"58960e4fc3a36822e000891d"},{"id":276575,"department":"Directing","original_language":"de","original_title":"Das verurteilte Dorf","job":"Director","overview":"East German propaganda film about an american army base trying to take away land from a west german village.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/tgI6OqjJdFNoQ4TMF9L5B2A5ecF.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Das verurteilte Dorf","popularity":1.007763,"genre_ids":[18],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1952-04-14","credit_id":"539b41020e0a264508001b8a"},{"id":276803,"department":"Directing","original_language":"de","original_title":"Der Ochse von Kulm","job":"Director","overview":"","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/jf96mfWCTfw2YH7GbwJM8GhHdvc.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Der Ochse von Kulm","popularity":1.052164,"genre_ids":[18],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1955-01-27","credit_id":"539dc45d0e0a26132c0050b8"},{"id":279729,"department":"Directing","original_language":"de","original_title":"Minna von Barnhelm oder Das Soldatenglück","job":"Director","overview":"This film takes place during the Seven Years' War.

Toss in a plot that has Weissmuller as a psycho-neurotic war veteran who, because he piled up his Navy destroyer on the rocks, now dreads returning to his pre-war occupation of a pilot guiding ships through the channels at the mouth of the Mississippi. Throw in icy Virginia Grey as a spoiled heiress out to take Johnny away from his job, his friends and the girl he loves (who knows why), and you have enough plot and action for two Pine-Thomas jewels.","release_date":"1946-09-06"},{"vote_count":14,"id":44260,"video":false,"vote_average":8,"title":"Lake of Fire","popularity":3.162322,"poster_path":"\/j8zKicyXBRwbzwHUsRfrxO4HQPk.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Lake of Fire","genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":"\/d4BRCKQvOvUMa3cQjvnS1jfPm8N.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"An unflinching look at the how the battle over abortion rights has played out in the United States over the last 15 years","release_date":"2006-09-09"},{"vote_count":1,"id":306750,"video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"title":"She Starts the Fire","popularity":2.200451,"poster_path":"\/lv0Ohx2NLwK9Jl6WQsoBOcu68gH.jpg","original_language":"cn","original_title":"Pen huo nu lang","genre_ids":[35,28],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Chingmy Yau stars in She Starts The Fire, a fish-out-of-water comedy where the fish can set people on fire!

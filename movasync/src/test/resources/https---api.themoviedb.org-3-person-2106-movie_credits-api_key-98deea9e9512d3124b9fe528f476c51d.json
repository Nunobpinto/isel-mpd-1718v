Fun and mischievous, the cheerful rabbit's popularity quickly multiplied, and so did his shorts. Between 1927 and 1928, Disney created a bounty of legendary and rarely seen Oswald cartoons. Now for the first time ever on DVD, the premiere collection of Disney's Oswald shorts -- all featuring new scores composed by Robert Israel especially for this release. The long-lost rabbit's life story, from his birth to his long-awaited return to Disney, and a documentary on the legendary Ub Iwerks set the stage for the comeback of one of the most important stars in Disney's menagerie. Featuring exclusive introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin, this is a timeless collection from generations past for generations to come.","vote_count":1,"video":true,"poster_path":"\/5w6eNvL97zTMW0RaF31izlt65SS.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Walt Disney Treasures: The Adventures Of Oswald The Lucky Rabbit","popularity":1.316104,"genre_ids":[16],"vote_average":10,"adult":false,"release_date":"2008-01-01","credit_id":"559de49dc3a368080e000973"},{"id":175997,"department":"Production","original_language":"en","original_title":"Pluto's Sweater","job":"Producer","overview":"Minnie knits an ugly pink sweater for Pluto, much to his disgust.

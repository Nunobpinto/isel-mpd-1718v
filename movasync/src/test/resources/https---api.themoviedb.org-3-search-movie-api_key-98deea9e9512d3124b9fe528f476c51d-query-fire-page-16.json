The aftermath is befuddling: there are townspeople who can recall incidents of racial violence and hate speech, and those who have never seen anything of the kind. Black folk in surrounding towns who share rumors and fears about acts of violence, and white folk who say you can't believe everything you hear. Fellow ministers who share the desire to be liberated from a racist past, and churchgoers who believe only mental illness could explain such a suicide.","release_date":"2018-01-24"},{"vote_count":2,"id":447771,"video":false,"vote_average":6,"title":"Barbara Stanwyck: Fire and Desire","popularity":1.577538,"poster_path":"\/fV1dMCH9ORoYfqfVXJXGNYYWlM6.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Barbara Stanwyck: Fire and Desire","genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Sally Field hosts this thorough documentary about actress Barbara Stanwyck.

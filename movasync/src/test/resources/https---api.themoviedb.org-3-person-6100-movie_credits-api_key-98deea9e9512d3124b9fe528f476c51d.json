His predecessor had greatly centralized the powers of government following the advice of Cardinal Richelieu. Louis XIV (often called \"The Sun King\" for the brilliance of his rule) followed the advice of Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin (Paolo Graziosi), and brought the powers of government under the sole sway of the monarch. He expanded the territory and influence of France in a series of wars throughout his reign. How he came to be so autocratic and ruthless both personally and politically is the subject of this biographical drama.","vote_count":1,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/9jYgDAGe6mDz0izWo6TazMBQT1g.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Louis, the Child King","popularity":1.351011,"genre_ids":[18,36,10752],"vote_average":7,"adult":false,"release_date":"1993-06-02","credit_id":"59cab026c3a368773d0026b9"},{"id":107883,"department":"Production","original_language":"fr","original_title":"Le bel été 1914","job":"Executive Producer","overview":"An old aristocrat, short of money, who does not accept the new world ruled by the bourgeois class ,epitomized by the industrialist and by the doctor who finally grabs the the aristocrat's castle which soon will be turned into a hospital.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/j4cZTStrflasT6U7kMzr79PzkJ4.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/iuAFcs5WLK8C1Gel2S8fz4EfCu8.jpg","title":"1914 the Glorious Summer","popularity":1.061974,"genre_ids":[18],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1996-11-11","credit_id":"59cabed0c3a368777b003201"},{"id":37563,"department":"Production","original_language":"fr","original_title":"Conte d'été","job":"Producer","overview":"A shy maths graduate takes a holiday in Dinard before starting his first job.

There is a certain absurdity to this, apparent to both adults, who though both reluctantly attracted to each other resent Darel's attempts at matchmaking. Nevertheless, both of them are intelligent enough to understand that there is no 'proper' way to meet, and are alive to the possibilities that life brings them.

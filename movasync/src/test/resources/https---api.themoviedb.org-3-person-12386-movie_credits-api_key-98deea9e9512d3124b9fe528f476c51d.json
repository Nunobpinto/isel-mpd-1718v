Lurid and disturbing, Golden Mouth delivers a savage satire of marriage and class pretensions, revealing a similar venality at the corroded heart of the sanctimonious bourgeoisie, the moneyed elite and the working class as they all mercilessly claw their way up and down the rickety and ruthlessly hierarchical Brazilian social ladder. -Harvard Film Archive","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/Af1LVeL0yCNGnmmwx4TYUOkHv8p.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Golden Mouth","popularity":1.001688,"genre_ids":[18],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1963-05-03","credit_id":"52fe4b959251416c75107a33"},{"id":147314,"department":"Directing","original_language":"pt","original_title":"El Justicero","job":"Director","overview":"A shockingly irreverent follow-up to the rural austerity of Barren Lives, dos Santos’ Godardian social satire owes more than a nod to the self-conscious antics of the French New Wave.

Filmed in both Manhattan and Brazil and set against the background of the Vietnam War and its protests, Hunger for Love uses a rigorously abstract soundtrack and narrative structure to evoke the acute paranoia of the period building up to the December 1968 military coup that tipped Brazil perilously close to a conservative dictatorship.

The population of his asylum grows as his definition of sanity fluctuates until it finally threatens to incorporate the entire town.

Openly embracing a mode of magical realism, dos Santos' celebrated film tells the story of a farming family defined by the absence of its father who abruptly abandoned his wife and children, sailing away down the river, including his son who continues to communicate with his father, speaking daily to him from the river bank. While offering an evocative vision of rural Brazil as a timeless land of mystery and solemnity, The Third Bank of the River is also bitingly satiric in the remarkable depiction of religious belief when the family moves to the city and its youngest member, a mesmerizing little girl, is revealed to be a kind of saint, capable of miraculous acts.  -Harvard Film Archive","vote_count":0,"video":false,"release_date":"1993-08-20","vote_average":0,"title":"The Third Bank of the River","popularity":1,"genre_ids":[18,14],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"poster_path":"\/7lAuWzIRe779OxfQB4Q7viURmaP.jpg","credit_id":"5a72aab90e0a266435004fca"},{"id":253374,"department":"Editing","original_language":"pt","original_title":"Cinco Vezes Favela","job":"Editor","overview":"Five segments about the hardships faced by people living in slums on hills in Rio de Janeiro.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"release_date":"1962-01-01","vote_average":0,"title":"Cinco Vezes Favela","popularity":1.024319,"genre_ids":[18],"backdrop_path":"\/jlkVjK2QxEcXs9rVi5tpfwEARnx.jpg","adult":false,"poster_path":"\/a7zAgdHcjjP6w2F90eiLDa8tio6.jpg","credit_id":"5a89935ac3a368633906ac25"},{"id":324446,"department":"Editing","original_language":"pt","original_title":"Maioria Absoluta","job":"Editor","overview":"Statistics, interviews and historical information on illiteracy and inequality in land distribution in Brazil's countryside.","vote_count":1,"video":false,"release_date":"1964-01-09","vote_average":10,"title":"Maioria Absoluta","popularity":1.05175,"genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"poster_path":"\/wSXdxEQFx0VUUQvZkkgju25ZK49.jpg","credit_id":"5a89977d0e0a2653db06ce02"},{"id":181619,"department":"Production","original_language":"pt","original_title":"Pra Frente, Brasil","job":"Assistant Production Manager","overview":"The film is set on mid-1970, when the military regime's \"economic miracle\" and the victory of the Brazilian national football team on the FIFA World Cup serves as a distraction for the persecution of opposition leaders by the political police of the dictatorship. Under this context, Jofre Godoi da Fonseca, an alienated middle class man, is mistaken for Sarmento, a political activist he met at an airport prior to his assassination. He is then arrested and brutally tortured by a paramilitary group of vigilantes sponsored by influential businessmen to hunt down people deemed \"subversive\" by the regime.","vote_count":1,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/hiDIJkyW3vD2JksGumQtC3zeAWt.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/fV1jA3AgnSmju8wK75UkAIx7e1r.jpg","title":"Pra Frente, Brasil","popularity":1.06,"genre_ids":[80,18],"vote_average":5,"adult":false,"release_date":"1982-04-01","credit_id":"5b0800be925141721f0065c8"},{"id":502077,"department":"Camera","original_language":"pt","original_title":"Uma Mensagem de Chico Xavier","job":"Camera Operator","overview":"","vote_count":0,"video":false,"release_date":"1972-01-01","vote_average":0,"title":"Uma Mensagem de Chico Xavier","popularity":1,"genre_ids":[99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"poster_path":"\/xH2QYtHqMGMJT6jK60j9PQrgK0c.jpg","credit_id":"5b0be20b9251411d9e00dec0"}],"id":12386}

Acting as narrator and guide, Wilkerson spins a strange, frightening tale, incorporating scenes from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, the music of Janelle Monáe and Phil Ochs, and the story of Rosa Parks’ investigation into the Recy Taylor case, as well as his own family history, for a gripping investigation into our collective past and its echoes into the present day.","release_date":"2017-01-20"},{"vote_count":14,"id":431244,"video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"title":"Lost in Florence","popularity":3.799003,"poster_path":"\/vZmtk5DoFlpaf26KOrb232wCAhr.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Lost in Florence","genre_ids":[12,18,10749],"backdrop_path":"\/fXSaWe6K1CiMNdx7oNZGbyMDi7V.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Eric Lazard is a heartbroken former college football star who gets involved in a dangerous Florentine sport and a local woman, Stephanie, while visiting his cousin Anna, who lives in Italy and teaches the Italian language to foreigners.","release_date":"2017-01-27"},{"vote_count":3,"id":136055,"video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"title":"Reassemblage: From the Firelight to the Screen","popularity":1.161694,"poster_path":"\/jAs8Y3U3sTnWHpi4cFKP8tkg6Wz.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Reassemblage: From the Firelight to the Screen","genre_ids":[],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Via Chris Damitio:\"On the surface level, the film is about the women of Senegal and the way they live.

And this is the story of a young boy who grew up in that country, and how he ended up challenging -- and sometimes even convincing -- the greatest powers in the world to follow Costa Rica's example. \"Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired\" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War politics and Communism, Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight, academic, and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years, as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end, it is a story about the triumph of reason, of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle, and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.","release_date":"2017-06-18"},{"vote_count":2,"id":44146,"video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"title":"D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes","popularity":1.476343,"poster_path":"\/uFp0etGCbKm6C2OPzQ8tCMWo7kn.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes","genre_ids":[10402],"backdrop_path":"\/231vNKRa924pZyl5LRStcBPZDi5.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"A strange combination of techno and New Wave music, the French duo Daft Punk caused an international dance sensation with their catchy hit \"Around The World.\" This fantastic French import showcases the fact that the duo's innovation carries over to the video realm from the musical one.

With such names, don't expect to see her playing Joan of Ark or  Electra but it remains that all these pet names reflect her winning  femininity, its sweetness, its spiciness, its radiance. What's more  their funny overtones are telltale signs of Iris Adrian's own quick  witty sense of humor. Sexy yes, but with a sharp tongue. This aspect of  her personality helped her to evolve and last, changing from the roles  of blonde chorines or waitresses or, on the wilder side, of  streetwalkers and other gangsters' molls to colorful bit parts in  comedies with Abbott and Costello, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley. She  ended up playing almost exclusively for Walt Disney productions before  retiring at the respectable age of 82. Though she never achieved star  status she could easily have if the circumstances had been favorable.  For she steals scenes in a lot of movies provided of course her role is  fleshed out sufficiently. She was excellent, for instance, in more than  one poverty row crime movies. Don't miss her in 'Gold Diggers of 1937',  'Go West' (with the Marx Brothers, 1940), 'Lady of Burlesque' (1943),  'The Paleface'(1948), 'Once a Thief' (1950) and 'The Errand Boy' (with  Jerry Lewis, 1961).\n\nDate of Death  17 September  1994, Hollywood, California   (aftermath of earthquake)","popularity":2.8e-05,"place_of_birth":"Los Angeles, California, USA","profile_path":"\/lLZZYHBg14NJ9aUt7BqeCQri36q.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0012441","homepage":null}

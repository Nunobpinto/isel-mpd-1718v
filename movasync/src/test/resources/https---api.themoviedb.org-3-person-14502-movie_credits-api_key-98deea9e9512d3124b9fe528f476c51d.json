He finds that rancher Artemus Taylor, an arthritic despot, and his henchies, Sam Tobin and Cree, are forcing out the settlers in order to claim their land for the incoming railroad. The plot nearly predates \"The Great Train Robbery\" in age but the gritty execution and well-acted performances take it out of the norm... way out, in a couple of instances. Brassy Myrna Dell is on hand as Taylor's independent daughter, only slightly less meaner than her father, and the always welcome Dorothy Malone is the pretty school marm on the side of good. Needless to say, Ireland's passive outlook on life changes before the end.","poster_path":"\/fuPOCbXMJYKIdJE8gO1AvYBjW0N.jpg"},{"character":"James Cooper","credit_id":"577af87dc3a3682435001126","release_date":"1967-08-18","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Hate for Hate","genre_ids":[37],"original_language":"it","original_title":"Odio per odio","popularity":1.002918,"id":90726,"backdrop_path":"\/tAsMWMSFLGLFxb9r3BO87K9qoTV.jpg","overview":"After being captured during a bank robbery, a cowboy is sent to a prison located in a swamp, where he contracts malaria.

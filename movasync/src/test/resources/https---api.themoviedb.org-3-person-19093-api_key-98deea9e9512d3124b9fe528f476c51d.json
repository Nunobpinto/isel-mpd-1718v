Marshall (December 29, 1891 – February 17, 1975) was a prolific American actor, screenwriter, producer, film and television director, active through the first six decades of movie history.\n\nRelatively few of Marshall's films are well-known today, with Destry Rides Again, The Sheepman, and How the West Was Won being the biggest exceptions. Marshall co-directed How the West Was Won with John Ford and Henry Hathaway, handling the railroad segment, which featured a celebrated buffalo stampede sequence. While Marshall worked on almost all kinds of films imaginable, he started his career in the early silent period doing mostly Westerns, a genre he never completely abandoned. Later in his career, he was particularly sought after for comedies. He did around half a dozen films each with Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis, and also worked with W.C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Will Rogers and Laurel and Hardy.\n\nFor his contribution to the film industry, George Marshall has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7048 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George  Marshall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","popularity":0.798266,"place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA ","profile_path":"\/i1FThWBJ62u2biOcrprrqRjAB9n.jpg","adult":false,"imdb_id":"nm0550892","homepage":null}

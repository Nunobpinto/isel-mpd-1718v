According to their social ranks, construction worker Edy is dating employee Siegi, while medical student Dieter is dating art school student Sonja. Rather unintentionally, they exchange partners. During a carnival ball, Dieter makes out with Siegi because he falls for her her fresh and happy girlish manner. Sonja coolly observes this game and sees this intermezzo as a test for their relationship. While Siegi and Dieter vacation at the sea, Sonja falls in love with Edy. Now the die seems to be cast for new constellations. But when both couples stand in front of the registrar’s office, they finally come to their senses.","poster_path":"\/i8QbONfGIrB8Cc2kII1S0HAHfS3.jpg"},{"character":"Polizei Offizier","credit_id":"52fe4441c3a36847f808b4c1","poster_path":"\/59bSbIy6T2zqwHRwd1fsbVA2R5Z.jpg","id":6155,"video":false,"vote_count":12,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/9N1AaCUvpQ5ticPyzYYUih705aW.jpg","genre_ids":[35,80],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Der Mann, der Sherlock Holmes war","popularity":2.277521,"title":"The Man Who Was Sherlock Holmes","vote_average":6.6,"overview":"Two out-of-work private detectives disguise themselves as Holmes and Watson to gain attention and end up chasing counterfeiters and stolen stamps.","release_date":"1937-07-14"},{"character":"Chefoffizier der Hofarchive","credit_id":"53c0543fc3a3684cdb005d6a","release_date":"1936-12-18","vote_count":1,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":3,"title":"Das Hofkonzert","genre_ids":[35,10749],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Das Hofkonzert","popularity":1.119901,"id":265386,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/Ehf84LCb5oxL7ILGpLYcHyNDsI.jpg"},{"character":"Kammerdiener des Prinzen","credit_id":"53c0587fc3a3687e590052a7","poster_path":"\/ryaGQjRVzi5FEYFM6dv6HqY6yT2.jpg","id":281534,"video":false,"vote_count":0,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[36],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Emilia Galotti","popularity":1.001305,"title":"Emilia Galotti","vote_average":0,"overview":"","release_date":"1958-03-14"},{"character":"Arzt","credit_id":"53c058b9c3a3684cdb005db6","release_date":"1958-09-25","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Der Prozeß wird vertagt","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Der Prozeß wird vertagt","popularity":1.007314,"id":279718,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null},{"character":"Oberst Bernbach","credit_id":"53c05b92c3a3684cf400554f","release_date":"1961-12-09","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Gewissen in Aufruhr","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Gewissen in Aufruhr","popularity":1.005291,"id":281538,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/arMn8na1bNeiXltXqjwWb9pgliO.jpg"},{"character":"Güttlers Onkel","credit_id":"53c05d91c3a3684cec0057fe","release_date":"1963-10-13","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Christine","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Christine","popularity":1.002441,"id":2222,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null},{"character":"Kriminalkommissar","credit_id":"53d100f10e0a265ded00cdac","release_date":"1939-03-16","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Männer müssen so sein","genre_ids":[80,18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Männer müssen so sein","popularity":1.009006,"id":266519,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/7mPeI9usnEAF6t0nUAVlpo7wNJm.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"563adfeec3a3681b520232eb","release_date":"1940-07-17","vote_count":2,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6,"title":"Die Rothschilds","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Die Rothschilds","popularity":1.470424,"id":277452,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"Anti-semitic Nazi propaganda \"biography\" of the Rothschilds, a German Jewish family whose members rose to the top of the European banking community during the Napoleonic era.","poster_path":"\/jNxvoi6SZT4SHQzndnFykkJPk2.jpg"},{"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5836d22f925141318f00f588","release_date":"1935-12-13","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Was bin ich ohne Dich","genre_ids":[35,10402],"original_language":"de","original_title":"Was bin ich ohne Dich","popularity":1.002503,"id":286037,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/5FnPk8QPGDZ0LCUyFt1ll35PSXh.jpg"}],"crew":[],"id":23020}

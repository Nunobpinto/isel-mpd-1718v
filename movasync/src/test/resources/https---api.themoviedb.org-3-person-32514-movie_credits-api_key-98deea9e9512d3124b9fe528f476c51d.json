The film shows us the evolving and ongoing dialogue between Greggory and Chéreau, a dialogue full of crises and magical moments of harmony and insight via which the truth, intensity, complexity, mystery and depth of Koltès’ text gradually emerge to form an implicit bond between these two men. The film also shows Chéreau directing rehearsals for Mozart’s \"Don Giovanni\" in Salzburg, revealing both the unity of and profound differences between his opera and theater work.","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/hGVPLBqH755GB18bs4f9rM40Yqf.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Patrice Chéreau, Pascal Greggory, une autre solitude","popularity":1.003905,"genre_ids":[99,10402],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1996-01-30","credit_id":"53e881910e0a266f91004093"}],"id":32514}

One night, eighteen-year-old Harry Jukes (British rock 'n roller Adam Faith in his first dramatic role) is driving down a deserted country road when he gets a flat tire. A policeman stops to help him out when a truck drives by, and the next thing Harry knows, the policeman is lying dead on the road and Harry is literally holding a smoking gun in his hand. From there to his arrest and trial is a brief hop, skip, and then a jump into prison to await his execution. His lawyer thinks he did it, but his psychiatrist (Anne Baxter) disagrees -- and sets out to prove she is right.","poster_path":"\/cN3pI01B4Dd80SY5Elr7eCbUpSI.jpg"},{"character":"Voice of the Gryphon (voice)","credit_id":"59045b6392514169c800a221","release_date":"1999-02-28","vote_count":102,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6.1,"title":"Alice in Wonderland","genre_ids":[14,10751],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Alice in Wonderland","popularity":8.016279,"id":30923,"backdrop_path":"\/17HRXLDNkqmzAZ3Jq3PV7rZUg3A.jpg","overview":"Alice follows a white rabbit down a rabbit-hole into a whimsical Wonderland, where she meets characters like the delightful Cheshire Cat, the clumsy White Knight, a rude caterpillar, and the hot-tempered Queen of Hearts and can grow ten feet tall or shrink to three inches.

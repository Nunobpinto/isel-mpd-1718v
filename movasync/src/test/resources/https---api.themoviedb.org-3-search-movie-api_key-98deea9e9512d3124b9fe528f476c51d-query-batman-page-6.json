Yep, there's more nudity in this film than every other Batman movie combined, which admittedly isn't much but we'll take what we can get. For some reason the dynamic duo sometimes have capes and sometimes don't. In one scene Batman even picks up a gun and shoots a couple of bad guys before tucking the gun into his belt. You won't see that in the comics. This time no clips from other films (that I noticed anyway) but lots of music is lifted from elsewhere, including the James Bond theme.","release_date":"1973-04-26"},{"vote_count":0,"id":220893,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Black Star and the Golden Bat","popularity":1.000001,"poster_path":"\/4pPfZiI7ObbAi5l7RwnFvoW1pWM.jpg","original_language":"ko","original_title":"검은별과 황금박쥐","genre_ids":[28,16,10751,878],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"","release_date":"1979-05-12"},{"vote_count":0,"id":467036,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Dark Justice","popularity":1.00238,"poster_path":null,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Dark Justice","genre_ids":[28],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"A Batman fan film in which Commissioner Gordon's daughter Barbara is kidnapped by a man he sent to prison 20 years before, and he asks for Batman's help to get her back.","release_date":"2003-12-31"}]}

Katnip cats a worm-baited hook into the fishbowl, but Finny puts on a napkin and eats the bait with a knife-and-fork. The cat-vs.-fish chase continues until Finny ends up in a bottle of wine, and Katnip quickly drinks the contents of the bottle, including little Finny. Katnip burps up Finny, and both the cat and fish end up as intoxicated buddies.","popularity":0.001746,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":null,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast and Furious","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}

The nominal leading man is Tommy Nelson (James Hall), the black-sheep son of a wealthy alumnus (Anders Randolph). Though Nelson is an ace football player, President Sheffield refuses to enroll the boy because of his bad reputation, whereupon Tommy's father withdraws his financial backing and bars his son from ever setting foot on Sheffield's campus. Falling in love with Nan, Tommy signs up with the college under an assumed name, giving up his wastrel ways to lead the football team to victory. Joe E. Brown steals the show as Speed Hanson, a goofy gridiron star who emits a loud and long yell whenever scoring a touchdown (this was, in fact, the first film in which Brown's famous \"Yeeeeowww\" was heard -- but certainly not the last).","vote_count":1,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/zsA8Yt05vTlspldcGrNE5G5efgT.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"title":"Maybe It's Love","popularity":1.053096,"genre_ids":[35,10749],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"1930-10-03","credit_id":"543e786cc3a3682513002283"},{"id":297577,"department":"Production","original_language":"en","original_title":"Josette","job":"Executive Producer","overview":"Two young men try to wrest their father from the clutches of a gold digger but by mistake think the woman is a young nightclub singer with whom they both fall in love.","vote_count":1,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/25EK81XuBNPWZ3d29UDl1dMFvh.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/99EidxrzhwjwuDxbDyKPdQny3G.jpg","title":"Josette","popularity":1.172641,"genre_ids":[35,80,10402],"vote_average":6,"adult":false,"release_date":"1938-06-03","credit_id":"543e88710e0a266f770024db"},{"id":258088,"department":"Production","original_language":"en","original_title":"Three Blind Mice","job":"Producer","overview":"Three sisters take their small inheritance and move from Kansas to California in search of rich husbands.

Ava Gardner plays his mother Empress Elisabeth. Rudolf soon feels he is a man born at the wrong time in a country that does not realize the need for social reform.

Rudolf finds refuge from a loveless marriage with Princess StÃ©phanie (AndrÃ©a Parisy) by taking a mistress, Baroness Maria Vetsera (Catherine Deneuve). Their untimely demise at Mayerling, the imperial family's hunting lodge, is cloaked in mystery, but the film's ending suggests the two lovers made a suicide pact when they decided they could not live in a world without love or prospects for peace.","poster_path":"\/eivbHqP3sgMPo3sD0sHrWTI0w58.jpg"},{"character":"Engine Room Officer Trotter","credit_id":"58387999c3a3684940001045","poster_path":"\/q3metVtBhJa6fxzh58B5DJ8xl2z.jpg","id":27917,"video":false,"vote_count":4,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/w9ali1hQaTpIJyvmzaDsT5njZzp.jpg","genre_ids":[80,18],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Pool of London","popularity":1.736191,"title":"Pool of London","vote_average":7.3,"overview":"Jewel thieves, murder and a manhunt swirl around a sailor (Bonar Colleano) off a cargo ship in London.","release_date":"1951-02-20"},{"character":"Branksome","credit_id":"5a989a569251412851000135","release_date":"1948-10-26","vote_count":5,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":6.7,"title":"Quartet","genre_ids":[18],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Quartet","popularity":2.346028,"id":100257,"backdrop_path":"\/4GmtpoFqNo86gh9kGzXneTk4Paj.jpg","overview":"Somerset Maugham introduces four of his tales in this anthology film: \"The Facts of Life,\" \"The Alien Corn,\" \"The Kite,\" and \"The Colonel's Lady.\"","poster_path":"\/jWvwfb3lxsZMsplIWLR1JM6C4lE.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5ab493dbc3a3686197018a5c","poster_path":null,"id":513477,"video":false,"vote_count":0,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Lucy in London","popularity":1,"title":"Lucy in London","vote_average":0,"overview":"Lucy goes to hip London to experience all the current fads.","release_date":"1966-10-24"}],"crew":[],"id":11130}

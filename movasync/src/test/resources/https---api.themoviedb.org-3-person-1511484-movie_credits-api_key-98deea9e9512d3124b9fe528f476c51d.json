His disappearance—which received almost no press—remains unsolved. An innovator in his sport, Rust custom-built bikes for Colorado’s mountain passes, starting a fat-tire revolution and designing gear that transformed the industry.  Salida native Nathan Ward, himself an intrepid mountain biker, set out to tell Rust’s story, tracking the pioneer’s subject through the infancy of the sport to his role in the thriving community that surrounds it today. Ward brings the riveting documentary to life with a unique local perspective and access. By combining interviews, re-enactments, home movies, and archival footage—and even consulting a psychic to communicate with Rust’s sprit—the director\/cinematographer attempts to find answers to this mystery full of loose ends and cold trails. -Denver Film Society","vote_count":0,"video":false,"poster_path":"\/blsenJ4373V0wPQAfMNQtPMvqyZ.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/6XabHVueJxHsX1JFetUCVJJtYMF.jpg","title":"The Rider & the Wolf","popularity":1.14507,"genre_ids":[99],"vote_average":0,"adult":false,"release_date":"2015-11-07","credit_id":"56279c5392514137c40024e1"},{"id":390784,"department":"Editing","original_language":"en","original_title":"Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back","job":"Editor","overview":"An art world upstart, provocative and elusive artist Maurizio Cattelan made his career on playful and subversive works that send up the artistic establishment, until a retrospective at the Guggenheim in 2011 finally solidified his place in the contemporary art canon.

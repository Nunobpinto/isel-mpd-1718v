Stan (Jiri Menzel) has been living in the attic apartment of his ex-wife's home, which he shares with a journalist friend (Andre Dussolier). One day, he has an accident which convinces his ex-wife and her current husband (Anna Romantowska and Pierre Arditi) that he's suicidal, and they hastily contact a media representative to see if some sort of publicity can't be arranged so that Stan's work can be published and they can benefit, if not from the money, then from their association with him. The organization they contact says that they will be happy to publish his writings, if he will commit suicide live, on television, in St. Peter's square, while the Pope is delivering an address.","release_date":"1993-02-10"},{"character":"Claude","credit_id":"5a4e94e10e0a26481401307e","release_date":"1983-12-20","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Monsieur Masure (théâtre)","genre_ids":[35],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Monsieur Masure (théâtre)","popularity":1,"id":496376,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/sYXySrv5wLzHn8LCBJPtkcvyeiD.jpg"},{"character":"Victor","credit_id":"5a5a48360e0a267fd700e6da","release_date":"2018-11-21","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Mauvaises herbes","genre_ids":[35],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Mauvaises herbes","popularity":1,"id":498249,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null},{"character":"Le séminariste","credit_id":"5ab0bdea0e0a2676d0007ff7","release_date":"1986-08-27","vote_count":1,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":9,"title":"Yiddish Connection","genre_ids":[35,80,18],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Yiddish Connection","popularity":1.080121,"id":46807,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":" ","poster_path":"\/plBBq1zlH2lamuV1oAP9uPfNCXT.jpg"},{"character":"The Aviator (voice)","credit_id":"5ab58b840e0a261fdf000c52","poster_path":"\/uUNd8rVnHxhl2DOtaU7itT2vv78.jpg","id":309809,"video":false,"vote_count":1015,"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/f5gs9YKhwdYNTaOKP7ePfu7V1HD.jpg","genre_ids":[12,16,14],"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Little Prince","popularity":10.592213,"title":"The Little Prince","vote_average":7.6,"overview":"Based on the best-seller book 'The Little Prince', the movie tells the story of a little girl that lives with resignation in a world where efficiency and work are the only dogmas.

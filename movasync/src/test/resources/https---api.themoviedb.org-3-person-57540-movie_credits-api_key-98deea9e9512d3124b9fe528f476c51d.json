Michele Morgan stars as the Austrian princess who becomes the last Queen of France in waning years of the 18th century. Jacques Morel costars as King Louis XVIII, Antoinette's slow-witted, ineffectual husband, while Richard Todd is the dashing European ambassador who briefly brings romance into the heroine's life. The episodic screenplay seldom sticks to the point long enough to detail the reasons behind the fall of the French aristocracy and the ultimate execution of the royal family. In addition, Michele Morgan is a bit too frosty and distant to warrant audience sympathy. Marie Antoinette was filmed simulatenously in French- and English-language versions.","poster_path":"\/8byR6YvrRLrQFjibOytRyVw4OnJ.jpg"},{"character":"acteur","credit_id":"52fe4c829251416c7511ca03","release_date":"1945-11-21","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Seul dans la nuit","genre_ids":[80],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Seul dans la nuit","popularity":1.012095,"id":182354,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/oSUgKhagB0Rdum0dXsRlUzsma1a.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"54f0e6fa9251416b2f000021","release_date":"1957-08-20","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Les Suspects","genre_ids":[80,18],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Les Suspects","popularity":1.002822,"id":327724,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":"\/vDytp2jm7j0EBho27OAkt0HycYt.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"54f312ee9251416b35003c61","release_date":"1953-04-09","vote_count":0,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Les amours finissent à l'aube","genre_ids":[],"original_language":"it","original_title":"Les amours finissent à l'aube","popularity":1.001965,"id":328053,"backdrop_path":null,"overview":"","poster_path":null},{"character":"Böhmer","credit_id":"56c04740c3a368180600ae74","release_date":"1954-11-11","vote_count":4,"video":false,"adult":false,"vote_average":9.3,"title":"Royal Affairs in Versailles","genre_ids":[35,18,36],"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Si Versailles m'était conté","popularity":2.023862,"id":67540,"backdrop_path":"\/hYynzn3gQkubbSlqnaviKCwc3D.jpg","overview":"Witty narration follows the history of Versailles Palace; founded by Louis XIII, enlarged by autocratic Louis XIV, whose personal affairs and amours, and those of his two successors, are followed in more detail to the start of the Revolution, after which the story is brought rapidly up to date.
